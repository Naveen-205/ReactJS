## 🟦 **REACT.JS QUESTIONS**

### 1️⃣ Why React was introduced?

**Answer:**
React was introduced to make building **dynamic and interactive user interfaces (UI)** easier and faster.
Before React, developers had to manually update the webpage every time data changed — which was slow and complex.
React solves this by using a **Virtual DOM** that updates only the changed parts of a webpage efficiently.

**Example:**
When you “like” a post on Facebook, only that like button updates — the entire page doesn’t reload.
➡️ This is possible because of React’s **Virtual DOM**.

---

### 2️⃣ What is React?

**Answer:**
React is a **JavaScript library** used for building **user interfaces (UI)**, especially **single-page applications (SPA)**.

It helps developers create reusable UI components like buttons, forms, cards, etc.

**Example:**

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, Naveen!</h1>;
}
```

This small code creates a **component** that displays “Hello, Naveen!”

### 3️⃣ Who developed React?

**Answer:**
React was developed by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer at **Facebook (now Meta)**, and it was released in **2013**.

---

### 4️⃣ Why do we use React?

**Answer:**
We use React because:

* ✅ It’s **fast** (Virtual DOM updates only necessary parts)
* 🔁 It’s **reusable** (components can be reused)
* ⚙️ It’s **maintainable** (code is modular)
* 🔄 It allows **real-time UI updates** without refreshing the page

**Example:**
In a shopping website, when you add an item to your cart, React updates the cart count instantly.

### 5️⃣ Difference between HTML webpage and React webpage

| Feature     | HTML Webpage                         | React Webpage                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Structure   | Built using HTML, CSS, JS separately | Built using components (JSX)      |
| Reload      | Page reloads for every change        | No reload (Single Page App)       |
| Data Update | Manual DOM manipulation              | Virtual DOM updates automatically |
| Speed       | Slower for dynamic content           | Faster and efficient              |
| Reusability | Hard to reuse code                   | Components are reusable           |

### 6️⃣ Difference between React, Angular, and Vue

| Feature        | React                                    | Angular                      | Vue              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Type           | Library                                  | Framework                    | Framework        |
| Language       | JavaScript / JSX                         | TypeScript                   | JavaScript       |
| Developer      | Facebook                                 | Google                       | Evan You         |
| Learning Curve | Easy to learn                            | Difficult                    | Easy             |
| DOM            | Virtual DOM                              | Real DOM (with optimization) | Virtual DOM      |
| Use Case       | Dynamic, fast apps (Facebook, Instagram) | Large enterprise apps        | Lightweight apps |

### 7️⃣ What is TypeScript?

**Answer:**
TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds **type safety**.
It helps catch errors during development (before running the code).

**Example:**

```typescript
let age: number = 25;  // ✅ valid
age = "twenty";        // ❌ Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

TypeScript makes code more reliable and easier to debug — it’s commonly used with **React and Angular**.

---

## 🟨 **JAVASCRIPT QUESTIONS**

### 8️⃣ What is a Variable?

**Answer:**
A **variable** is used to store data in memory.
Example:

```javascript
let name = "Naveen";
let age = 21;
```

Here, `name` and `age` are variables.

---

### 9️⃣ What is Declaration?

**Answer:**
**Declaration** means creating a variable (without giving value).
Example:

```javascript
let a;  // declaration
```

---

### 🔟 What is Initialization?

**Answer:**
**Initialization** means assigning a value to a declared variable.
Example:

```javascript
a = 10;  // initialization
```

Or together:

```javascript
let a = 10;  // declaration + initialization
```

---

### 11️⃣ What is Scope?

**Answer:**
**Scope** means the area where a variable can be accessed.
There are mainly:

* Global scope
* Function scope
* Block scope

---

### 12️⃣ What is Lexical Scope?

**Answer:**
**Lexical scope** means **a function can access variables from its parent (outer) function**.

**Example:**

```javascript
function outer() {
  let name = "Naveen";
  function inner() {
    console.log(name); // inner can access outer variable
  }
  inner();
}
outer(); // Output: Naveen
```

---

### 13️⃣ What is Block Scope?

**Answer:**
Variables declared inside `{ }` using `let` or `const` are **block scoped** (cannot be accessed outside).

**Example:**

```javascript
{
  let x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ❌ Error: x is not defined
```

---

### 14️⃣ What is Functional Scope?

**Answer:**
Variables declared inside a function using `var` are **function scoped** (accessible only inside that function).

**Example:**

```javascript
function demo() {
  var x = 20;
}
console.log(x); // ❌ Error: x is not defined
```

---

### 15️⃣ What is Hoisting?

**Answer:**
**Hoisting** means JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

Here, JS internally does this:

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;
```

---

### 16️⃣ What are Closures?

**Answer:**
A **closure** is a function that remembers the variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.

**Example:**

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

The `inner` function remembers `count` even after `outer()` is done — that’s a closure.

### 17️⃣ In web development process — why Node is used? Which came first: Node, React, or Angular?

**Answer:**

* **Node.js** is a **runtime environment** that lets JavaScript run **outside the browser** (like on a server).
* It allows developers to build **backend (server-side)** applications using JavaScript.

**Example:**
Before Node.js, JavaScript could only run inside browsers.
With Node.js, we can create servers, connect databases, and build APIs.

🕓 **Order of release:**

1. **Node.js** – 2009
2. **AngularJS** – 2010
3. **React.js** – 2013

➡️ So, **Node.js came first**, then Angular, then React.
